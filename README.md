# Tank-X

The game I made when I was 14 years old. It was created by using Game Maker, but in development process I used less visual programming, and more "real" coding with GM script language.

Some of the game features:
* 3 game modes with different objectives;
* 5 enemy types, with different guns and behaviour;
* 5 bonuses for player: speed up, +hp, +life, +rate of fire, shield;
* system of the enemy spawn, which manage their count and general difficulty;
* bullet collisions with different hp of every type of bullet.

Pretty hardcore game. :)
Not so enjoyable, but not bad for very first game in life, I think.
